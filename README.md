# UX



## About the business - 
The business was founded in 2019 by a local entreprenur. There was a niche in the market for insider local knowledge about where to really visit when in County Clare. 
It takes the stress out of trying to decide what to see and do in such a limited time. 

The real and "not well" known treasures of Co Clare are part of the iterery. 

## Project Goals for the business -
We have built an impressive website in order to create a strong online presence and promote this fabulous new business. The site is colourful and easy 
to use. There are plenty of appealing visuals which increases dwell time on the site. We have linked up the partners own website so that the client 
can find out even more about the six sights - we have nine suggestion. We provide three diverse suggestions for the following 3 categories: "Must See", "Must Try", "Must Stay". For example, stay in dromoland for a night and then enjoy the outdoors glamping in Doolin.
Also we have provided a suitcase ( to do list). Just click on the button to add the item to your list for today. Once you have the sight visited you can click on the item on your list and it will disappear.

The website provides:

*	An attractive visually appealing site that will catch the browsers attention when them come across it.
*   The use of suitable colours,  typograph, imagery across all sections to make browsing the various must do, must try etc. clear for the users.

*	We get straight to it. The list is there. The information is there. Just sign up and your away.

*	The suggestions go from high end to low, fish to chocolate. For the user it is clear that they will experience a varied and rounded experience in Co Clare.

*	The site drives traffic to the websites of the suggested venues.

*	The site allows you to create your own "TO DO" list with the suggested sights

*	The site is not overly burdened with words. They appear if you want to READ ON.

*	Ultimately â€“ the site will promote this business and the other visitor attractions in Clare.

## Testing


* Throughout the writing and styling of the document I ran Devtools from google crome each and every time in an effort to make sure my website 
was responsive across all devices.

* The code was put through W3C Validators for HTML and CSS3 with no issues found.

* Every inch of the website was checked - all the links and interactive buttons and click were check numberous times.

#### Other users

Feed back from friends and family I asked to test the site was as follows:

* That the site was easy to use.  

* Interesting and nicely interactive.

* It was easy to get back to the home page by clicking on the home buttons throughout the site.
* It was easy to find the social media links at the bottom of every page
* It was nice to read a snippet about the attractions.
* The signup here form was eye catching and simple to fill out. 
* Different type of devices were used and the user found that the site was managable on mobiles & tables also.
* The phone number for the business was clear to see on each page and every device.

One example of testing went as follows:
>Test: To make sure the "Suitcase button" is working correctly. 
>> 1. Log on to the website. 
>>2. Click on the suitcase buttom beside any of the "must see", "must try" "must Stay" and when you check your suit case the attraction is listed. When you click on the item in the list it removes it.  
>>>3 The test that the form is behaving correctly is that we miss a field and the page says its require and won't move on until it is filled in correctly.


## BUGS: 

1) On extra Small devices I found the model went up under the nav bar 
so i had to use the class="d-none d-sm-block" to hide a particular paragraph. I use this tactic throughout where needed on the smalled devices.

2) I had a problem with the height of the section - it just was not rendering correctly and so by using VH instead of px or % it fixed this bug.

3) The google map would not appear - it just flashed! I gave a min-height to its div and this fixed the problem.
